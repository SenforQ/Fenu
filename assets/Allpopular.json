The Fjaðrá River flows gently through the canyon bottom.\n\nSteep cliffs on both sides with delicate rock formations, combined with green vegetation, create visually stunning natural scenery\n\nRivers and waterfalls in the canyon depths add mystery and beauty, especially after rain when water flow is abundant, the scene is more spectacular.\n\nWalk along the trail above the canyon to enjoy panoramic views, best viewing point at the end of the trail overlooking the entire canyon.\nBest visiting time: May to September is the best tourist season, mild summer climate suitable for hiking and outdoor activities."

Booked a two-day tour from Las Vegas to visit the long-awaited Antelope Valley & Colorado Grand Canyon. Cracks are indeed a form of beauty.\n\nD1 Grand Canyon - Horseshoe Bend\nGot up early to head to the Grand Canyon from textbooks. Even in air-conditioned car, could feel the scorching heat outside almost causing heatstroke. Along the way in desert shops, first encountered California where everyone makes Trump memes.\nAlthough seen countless pictures in textbooks, the real Grand Canyon still shocked me. Its massive scale far exceeds imagination, said to be the only Earth crack visible from space.\nAt sunset headed to Horseshoe Bend, people from around the world sitting on cliffs without railings. Some year some day, we watched the same sunset with strangers at some distant place, also a kind of romance.\nD2 Antelope Valley - Zion National Park\nOne of the most anticipated places on this trip. Golden purple red cracks in sunlight, Colorado River-carved gelato-like textures, most shocking moment wasn't walking inside. But when you walk from canyon back to ground, hard to imagine such a thin crack contains such a bizarre world.\nZion National Park was just a photo stop, unique for its multi-layered colorful mountain terrain."

As a visual person, this dreamy pink lake is simply the best gift from heaven for girls～\n\nToday I want to share with you the 4 stunning pink salt lakes I visited in Australia, each one is breathtakingly beautiful!\n\n🌸 Lake Hillier Most Dreamy\n8-hour drive from Perth, but absolutely worth it! Lake water shows unique strawberry milkshake color, forming beautiful contrast with deep blue Indian Ocean. I chose to take a sightseeing plane for aerial view, that moment was truly shocking - perfect blend of pink, blue, green colors, like a natural watercolor painting.\n\n📸 Photo Tips: Recommend booking 9-11am flights, light is best for aerial photography.\n\n🎀 Hutt Lagoon Most Variable\nPink here changes with time, from light pink to deep purple possible! I specifically chose sunset time to visit, lake surface covered with pink-purple glow, unreal beauty. Standing by the lake, gently touching crystallized salt particles, like touching a fairy tale world.\n\n📸 Photo Tips: 1 hour before sunset is best shooting time, lake color most vibrant.\n\n💝 Lake Bumbunga Best for Photos\n2-hour drive from Adelaide, my most recommended spot! Salt crystal layers here perfect for creativity, I drew a big heart on salt layer with pink lake water, photos came out so beautiful!\n\n📸 Photo Tips: Bring small mirror, can create seamless sky-lake connection effect.\n\n🌸 Lake MacDonnell Most Photogenic\nThere's a super popular 'internet famous road' here, pink lake water on one side, blue-green seawater on the other. Took many creative photos here, standing in middle of road for photos definitely gets great shots!\n\nPractical Tips:\nRecommend renting car for self-drive, convenient for multiple spots\nPrepare sunscreen, strong reflection by lake\nRecommend bringing mirror props for more creative photos\nChoose sunny day, cloudy weather affects lake color"

Afternoon turned cloudy, lake surface became gray, check weather forecast before departure, must go on sunny days,\n\nHiking route: Cable car starting point loop about 12km, walking and stopping for photos about 4 hours, 600m elevation gain, recommend wearing hard-soled anti-slip hiking shoes. Before going down played slide, 6CHF per ride.\n\nReturning to Interlaken passed Speiz town for quick visit, scenery also nice (last two photos).\n\nPersonally think Interlaken most worth visiting Oeschinensee Lake, beats First Mountain, although haven't been (tomorrow/next day raining, probably scenery not great), and First mainly entertainment activities."
